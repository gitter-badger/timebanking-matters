In the _Harvard Business Review article_, [How Understanding Disruption Helps Strategists](https://hbr.org/2015/11/how-understanding-disruption-helps-strategists), author [Scott Anthony](https://hbrblogs.wordpress.com/scott-anthony/) states:
> All good ideas have three pieces:
> - First, they target a real market need, even if that need can’t be readily articulated by the customer.
> - Second, they deliver against that need consistently in the face of current and future competition.
> - Third, the numbers work, allowing the company to create and capture value.

[Robert Moran’s](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robertpmoran) “Taxonomy of Insights,” featured in this [GreenBook post](http://www.greenbookblog.org/2015/11/23/robert-p-morans-taxonomy-of-insights/) by [Jeffrey Henning](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jhenning), offers another dimension about “good ideas”.

The posting begins by introducing the classic [Information Hierarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIKW_Pyramid) with Data as the base, added upon by layers of Information and Knowledge, and culminating with Wisdom at the apex.

Curiously, Henning’s ensuing argument makes several references to data, information, and knowledge, but does not mention wisdom.  A possible cause for this oversight could be that data, information, and knowledge are increasingly within the grasp of individuals whereas wisdom is the emergent, unpredictable outcome of social discourse and collective voice as stated in [Empowering Public Wisdom-The Manifesto](http://empoweringpublicwisdom.us/the-manifesto/):
> Even as we increase the diversity, power, and connectivity of our individual voices, it is becoming possible for We the People, as a whole, to speak with one wise voice …

If we apply this notion of public wisdom to the criteria for “good ideas” in the HBR article as summarized above, a possible fourth piece would be the question:

Just because we have the data, information, and knowledge to deliver an idea successfully into the market, should we?

Or a variant query:

One idea has positive short term gains but negative long-term consequences versus another which costs more and gains less in the short term but shows potential for a long run without negative consequences, which one do we opt for?

How would you answer these questions?  Or if not you alone, how would you petition the domain of public wisdom where “We the People, as a whole, … speak with one wise voice …”?
